# Code Library

Code Library is a personal repository for organizing and tracking useful scripts and code snippets. This collection serves as a centralized location for storing and managing various pieces of code that I've written or collected over time.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this repository are:

1. **Organization**: To keep code snippets and scripts neatly organized and easily accessible.
2. **Tracking**: To maintain a history of code changes and developments over time.
3. **Reference**: To serve as a quick reference for commonly used or particularly useful pieces of code.

## Contents

This repository may contain a variety of code snippets and scripts in different programming languages. Each item in the library is stored in its own folder, depending on its complexity and related resources.

## Usage

This is a personal repository primarily for my own use. However, feel free to explore the contents if you find them helpful. Please note that the code here may not be actively maintained or documented for public use.

## Contributing

As this is a personal repository, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you have suggestions or spot any issues, feel free to open an issue for discussion.

## License

This project is for personal use. All rights are reserved unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific pieces of code.
