# Palindrome Number

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, determine if it is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as it does forward.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: x = 121 
Output: true 
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

Input: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
